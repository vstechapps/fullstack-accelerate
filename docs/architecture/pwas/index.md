# [Fullstack Architecture](../) > 🌐 Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)

A **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** is a type of web application that combines the best features of web and native apps. PWAs are fast, reliable, and engaging, offering a seamless user experience across devices and platforms. They leverage modern web technologies to provide offline capabilities, push notifications, and app-like performance.

## ❓ Why Progressive Web Applications?

PWAs are gaining popularity due to their numerous advantages:

- ⚡ **Fast Performance**: PWAs load quickly, even on slow networks, providing a smooth user experience.
- 📶 **Offline Support**: PWAs work offline or in low-connectivity environments using service workers.
- 📱 **App-Like Experience**: PWAs mimic the look and feel of native apps with responsive design and smooth interactions.
- 🔔 **Push Notifications**: Engage users with timely updates and notifications.
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform**: PWAs run on any device with a modern browser, eliminating the need for platform-specific development.

---

## 📦 Characteristics of PWAs

- 🌐 **Responsive Design**: PWAs adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- 📤 **Installable**: Users can add PWAs to their home screen without downloading from an app store.
- 📶 **Offline Capabilities**: PWAs cache resources and data to function offline.
- 🔒 **Secure**: PWAs are served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
- 🔄 **Always Up-to-Date**: PWAs automatically update in the background.

## 🛠️ How PWAs Work

1. **Service Workers**: A script that runs in the background to handle caching, offline functionality, and push notifications.
2. **Web App Manifest**: A JSON file that defines the app's metadata, such as name, icons, and start URL.
3. **HTTPS**: Ensures secure communication between the app and the server.
4. **Caching**: Resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images are cached for offline access.
