# [Fullstack](../../) > [Architecture](../) > 🎭 MVC Architecture

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture is a widely adopted design pattern for building scalable, maintainable, and modular applications. It separates an application into three main logical components: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**. Each of these components handles specific responsibilities within the application.

## ❓ Why MVC?

MVC helps organize code by separating business logic from UI and user interaction logic. This leads to:

- 🛠️ **Better maintainability**  
- ✅ **Easier testing**  
- 📈 **Scalable structure**  
- 🔄 **Reusability of components**  
- ✨ **Clear separation of concerns**

## 🧩 MVC Components

### 1️⃣ Model

The **Model** represents the application's data and business logic. In a fullstack Spring Boot + Angular application, this layer typically includes:

- 🗂️ **Entity classes** that map to the database schema  
- 📦 **DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes** that define the structure of data exchanged between frontend and backend  
- 🔄 **Mappers** for converting between Entities and DTOs  

The model ensures data consistency and encapsulates business rules. DTOs help decouple internal persistence models from external API contracts.

### 2️⃣ View

The **View** is the presentation layer of the application. Its role is to display data to the user and capture user interactions. In a Spring Boot + Angular fullstack application, the view layer can exist in both the backend and frontend, depending on architecture.

In the **backend (Spring Boot)**, the view can be:

- 📡 **JSON API responses** (common in REST APIs)  
- 🖼️ **HTML** using Thymeleaf or similar template engines  
- 📜 **JSP pages** (in legacy Java web apps)  
- 🗂️ **XML or other formats** (for API integration or legacy systems)  

In the **frontend (Angular)**, the view is composed of:

- 🎨 Angular components and HTML templates  
- 🔗 UI logic and data-binding mechanisms  

#### View Responsibilities

- 🖥️ Render UI based on model data  
- 🖱️ Capture user interactions and inputs  
- 📤 Display feedback and results returned from the controller  

---

### 3️⃣ Controller

The **Controller** manages the flow of data between the View and the Model. In Spring Boot, controllers expose REST APIs that serve data and handle client requests.

Controller responsibilities include:

- 📥 Handling HTTP requests  
- 🛠️ Calling service and model layers  
- 📤 Returning appropriate responses (DTOs or errors)

## 🌍 MVC in Fullstack Applications

### Backend (Spring Boot)

- 🗂️ **Model**: JPA Entities, DTOs, and Mappers  
- 📡 **View**: 
  - JSON API responses (typical in REST APIs)  
  - HTML (Thymeleaf), JSP, or XML for server-rendered UIs  
- 🛠️ **Controller**: REST or web controllers using Spring

### Frontend (Angular)

- 🗂️ **Model**: Angular interfaces and services  
- 🎨 **View**: Angular HTML templates  
- 🛠️ **Controller**: Component class logic and data binding
