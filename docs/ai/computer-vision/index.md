## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It gives computers the ability to see, analyze, and make decisions based on visual data.

## Key Capabilities

- **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects, people, scenes, and activities
- **Object Detection**: Locating and classifying multiple objects in images/videos
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifying and analyzing human faces
- **Image Segmentation**: Dividing images into meaningful regions
- **Video Analysis**: Understanding motion and tracking objects over time

## Applications

- Security surveillance systems
- Medical diagnosis and imaging
- Autonomous vehicles and drones
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Augmented reality applications
- Social media photo tagging
- Retail inventory management

## Getting Started

To begin with Computer Vision:
1. Learn basic image processing concepts
2. Practice with popular libraries like OpenCV
3. Start with simple image classification tasks
4. Gradually move to more complex applications

*Computer Vision is transforming how machines interact with the visual world, opening new possibilities for automation and intelligent systems.*
