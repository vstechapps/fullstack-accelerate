# [AI](../) > 🎨 Generative AI

Generative AI is a branch of AI that enables software applications to generate new content; often natural language dialogs, but also images, video, code, and other formats.

The ability to generate content is based on a language model, which has been trained with huge volumes of data - often documents from the Internet or other public sources of information.

Generative AI models encapsulate semantic relationships between language elements (that's a fancy way of saying that the models "know" how words relate to one another), and that's what enables them to generate a meaningful sequence of text.

## 🧠 Types of Language Models

There are large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) - the difference is based on the volume of data and the number of variables in the model. 

- **🚀 LLMs** are very powerful and generalize well, but can be more costly to train and use
- **⚡ SLMs** tend to work well in scenarios that are more focused on specific topic areas, and usually cost less

## 🔮 Generative AI Scenarios

Common uses of generative AI include:

- **💬 Implementing chatbots and AI agents** that assist human users
- **📝 Creating new documents or other content** (often as a starting point for further iterative development)
- **🌐 Automated translation** of text between languages
- **📚 Summarizing or explaining** complex documents

## 💻 Applications in Development

Generative AI has become an invaluable tool in modern software development:

- **⌨️ Code Generation**: AI can help generate boilerplate code, suggest implementations, and provide coding examples
- **📖 Documentation**: Automatically generate API documentation, user guides, and technical specifications
- **🧪 Testing**: Generate test cases, mock data, and test scenarios
- **🐛 Debugging**: AI can help identify potential issues and suggest fixes
- **🎓 Learning**: Provide explanations and examples for complex programming concepts
