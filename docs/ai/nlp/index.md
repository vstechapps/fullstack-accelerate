# üí¨ [AI](../) > NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding, making it possible for software applications to process and respond to natural language input.

## üéØ **What is NLP?**

NLP combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It enables machines to:

- **Understand** human language in various forms (text, speech, handwriting)
- **Interpret** meaning, context, and intent from language
- **Generate** human-like responses and content
- **Translate** between different languages
- **Extract** meaningful information from unstructured text
