#### üìê Viewport & Meta Tags

````
---

#### üìè Relative Units (%, em, rem, vw, vh)

- `%` for container-relative sizing
- `em`, `rem` for font scaling
- `vw`, `vh` for viewport-based layout
````html
    .container {
      width: 90%;
      padding: 2rem;
    }

    h1 {
      font-size: 3vw;
    }

#### üß∞ CSS Media Queries

- Customize styles for different breakpoints

  - Small (`max-width: 576px`)
  - Medium (`min-width: 768px`)
  - Large (`min-width: 992px`)
  - XL (`min-width: 1200px`)
````html
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      .nav {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    }

    @media (min-width: 992px) {
      .hero {
        font-size: 2rem;
      }
    }
````

- Use `min-width` media queries to scale up

#### üß© Responsive Layouts with Flexbox & Grid

- Flexbox: auto-wrap and align
- CSS Grid: define areas and columns
````html
    .container {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    .grid {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
    }

#### üåÜ Responsive Images

- Use `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`
- `<picture>` and `srcset` for art direction
````html
    <img src="hero.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <picture>
      <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="hero-large.jpg">
      <img src="hero-small.jpg" alt="Responsive image">
    </picture>
